Tycho supports non-standard (as of Eclipse 3.6M6, at least) .product file
os/ws/arch attributes of <plugin/> element. If specified, these attributes
will be used to filter out irrelevant bundles when resolving RCP application
dependencies from P2 repositories. This is similar to os/ws/arch filtering
supported by feature-based products.
